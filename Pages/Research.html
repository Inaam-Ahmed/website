        <p> Smart phone users spend more time on their mobile devices equipped with advanced features such as GPS, the Internet etc. It has attracted E-marketing companies to market their brands on mobile in as sense shift from E-marketing to M-marketing. Higher level enterprises have successfully captured huge marketplace using mobile advertising. But small and medium enterprises are still using the social media promotions without knowing customers location and any other contextual information. In this study, a context-aware Location Based Advertisement system (LBA system) is being proposed. LBA system uses the contextual information of the users to extract from a bunch of ads the most relevant ads. To validate the result field experiment is being conducted on ninety-five participants and eighteen thousand response on one hundred and ninety-three different ads uploaded by eighteen vendors of Mirpur city Azad Kashmir. Experiments show that location congruent advertisements are more relevant and attractive to the users then location in-congruent advertisements. A comparison with other techniques is being performed and the statistics suggest that the model proposed in this study is better in getting a positive response from users in sense of relevancy.
